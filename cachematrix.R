## Calculates the inverse of a matrix and stores it into cache. If it was already calculated takes it from memory.



## Creates an object, with setters and getters, in the form of a list. 
## Because of closure (and the use of the <<-), it gives access to the variables from the environment.
##It is meant to store a matrix, with or without its inverse, in memory; to be used by cachesolve(). 




makeCacheMatrix <- function(A = matrix()) {
                   Ainv <- NULL
                   SetMatrix <- function(B){
                     A <<- B
                     Ainv <<- NULL
                   }
                   GetMatrix <- function() A
                   SetInverse <- function(inverse) Ainv <<- inverse 
                   GetInverse <- function() Ainv
                list(SetMatrix = SetMatrix, GetMatrix = GetMatrix,SetInverse = SetInverse,GetInverse = GetInverse)   
}




## Takes an object of the form given by makeCacheMatrix(). If the inverse was already calculated, it retrieves it from memory.  
## Otherwise, it calculates it with solve(), e.i. it assumes the matrix is invertible.
